The folders "Fig2a", "Fig2b","Fig3","Fig4a","Fig4b" and "Fig5" are about the simulations.

The folder “Samples” includes the

1) weights https://github.com/xinxingwu/Distributed-Simulation/tree/master/Samples/Weights

2) testing samples https://github.com/xinxingwu/Distributed-Simulation/tree/master/Samples/TestingSamples

3) training samples with noise (0.5) https://github.com/xinxingwu/Distributed-Simulation/tree/master/Samples/TrainingSamplesWithNoise0.5

4) training samples with noise (1) https://github.com/xinxingwu/Distributed-Simulation/tree/master/Samples/TrainingSamplesWithNoise1

In addition, if using PyCharm to run the codes, it needs to configure the Project Interpreter. Please see https://github.com/xinxingwu/Distributed-Simulation/blob/master/Supplyment/PycharmEnvironmentSetting.gif
